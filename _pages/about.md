I am a Professor and Ph.D. Supervisor at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/), appointed as a Changjiang Scholar Distinguished Professor by China’s Ministry of Education and serving as Chief Scientist of a National Key R&D Program. I lead the Institute of Intelligent Control and oversee the university’s degree programs in Control Science and Engineering and Electronics & Information.

My research lies at the intersection of multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and collaborative robotics—with a focus on distributed control and optimization under communication constraints, noise, and dynamic network topologies. I have published over 150 papers, including 6 *Automatica* (5 long), 4 *IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control*, and 40+ other IEEE Transactions articles, totaling 5,000+ Google Scholar citations. I am author of a Springer monograph, holder of 16 patents, and recipient of multiple awards, including two Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Prizes and the Wu Wenjun AI Science Award.

I serve as Associate Editor for *Information Sciences* and *Neurocomputing*, Senior Member of IEEE, and active organizer of major conferences (e.g., Secretary-General of the Chinese Control Conference). My lab develops real-world multi-robot platforms—integrating wheeled robots, drones, and binocular vision—for applications in formation control and autonomous manipulation.
